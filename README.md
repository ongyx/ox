# oxlang: the ox programming language

ox is a intepreted, dynamic programming language inspired by [Cub] (no relation to the [2011] one.)
It's syntax heavily borrows from Cub itself and [golang].

Since ox keeps most of Cub's semantics, existing Cub code should run in ox (backward-compatible).

ox is not meant to be a production language: rather as an experiment in implementing a programming language entirely in Python.
