// ox is kind of like untyped Swift (which is also what Cub was aiming for).
// Currently, these primitive types are supported:

// Strings (to have double quotes in a string, use single quotes, and vice versa.)
// Of course, UTF-8 is supported.
//my_var = "Hello World!"

// Numbers are all floating-point as in Cub.
// Like Python, variables do not have a fixed type, and can be reassigned.
// (The '.0' can be omitted.)
//my_var = 42

// Booleans can either be true or false.
// Comparisons will return a boolean.
//a_bool = true
//is_the_answer_to_life_and_everything = my_var >= 42

// Arrays are analogous to lists.
// To append, use '+='.
//an_array = [4, 2, 0]
//an_array += [1]

// Functions define an operation so you don't have to keep copying and pasting the same section of code.
